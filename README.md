# RoboticsSensorStateDeepLearning

This is a deep learning program that uses Q Learning to teach a robot how to navigate out of a warehouse while avoiding a person walking around. The states used for Q Learning are GPS values and radar sensor. The program runs in Matlab 2019a. The results are summarized in the pdf paper of this repository.
